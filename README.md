# tur-col-asia
This repository is where I will upload the codes that I have been working on in my free time in order to apply what I have learned in Python on topics of interest. The first notebook uploaded to the repository corresponds to a final project for the Graphical Application of Data in Python course at the University of Michigan on Coursera. The others that I will upload correspond to a certain personal interest in working on tourism issues, which is why my motivation is to apply what I have learned in something that catches my attention. I will focus these works on the Asia-Colombia tourist flow, which I consider has enormous growth potential and even more so in the coming years when tourism needs to be reactivated.
