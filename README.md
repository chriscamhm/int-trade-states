<h1><left> General Objective </left></h1>
The following code shows the process from data collection to the final graph. The objective of this part of the project is to look at the evolution of Asian tourism in Colombia. For this purpose, an animated bar graph was used that changes over time and shows the 8 countries with the most entries to Colombia quarter by quarter from 2015 to the end of 2019. The data from 2015 to 2017 were extracted from the Migración Colombia website. which are monthly so they were grouped together to see it quarterly. While for 2018 and 2019 they were downloaded from the Tableau dashboards provided by Migración Colombia. The links are the following:
